# The provided script trims adapters from the provided fastq files using the
# Trim Galore's auto-detection feature. The minimum length of a sequence after
# trimming is defaulted to 20, edit this by adding flag -q <min_interger>,
# this is an optional addition to the script. The script will output an array
# of files that include the trimmed files named "base_val_#.fastq". 
#
# OPTIONAL: If you would like to analyze the quality of your sample, 
# you can run the following:
$nohup fastqc "base_val_#.fastq" >> fastqc_base.log &

# The use of nohup and the "&" are optional and allows your command to be run
# in the background.
